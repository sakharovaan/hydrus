			<h3>running from source</h3>
			<p>I write the client and server entirely in <a href="https://python.org">python</a>, which can run straight from source. It is not simple to get hydrus running this way, but if none of the built packages work for you (for instance you use a non-Ubuntu-compatible flavour of Linux), it may be the only way you can get the program to run. Also, if you have a general interest in exploring the code or wish to otherwise modify the program, you will obviously need to do this stuff.</p>
			<h3>a quick note about Linux flavours</h3>
			<p>I often point people here when they are running non-Ubuntu flavours of Linux and cannot run my build. One Debian user mentioned that he had an error like this:</p>
			<p><ul>
				<li><i>ImportError: /home/user/hydrus/libX11.so.6: undefined symbol: xcb_poll_for_reply64</i></li>
			</ul></p>
			<p>But that by simply deleting the <i>libX11.so.6</i> file in the hydrus install directory, he was able to boot. I presume this meant my hydrus build was then relying on his local libX11.so, which happened to have better API compatibility. If you receive a similar error, you might like to try the same sort of thing. Let me know if you discover anything!</p>
			<h3>what you will need</h3>
			<p>First, install some packages in a way specified by your distribution that <i>may</i> be required for wxPython and whole app to operate (example from xUbuntu 18.04):</p>
			<ul>
				<li>sudo apt install make gcc libgtk-3-dev libwebkitgtk-dev libwebkitgtk-3.0-dev libgstreamer-gl1.0-0 freeglut3 freeglut3-dev python-gst-1.0 python3-gst-1.0 libglib2.0-dev ubuntu-restricted-extras libgstreamer-plugins-base1.0-dev</li>
				<li>sudo apt install libsdl1.2-dev gstreamer-1.0 libgstreamer-plugins-base1.0-dev v4l-utils freeglut3-dev libgtk-3-dev libglw1-mesa libglw1-mesa-dev python-dev</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Then, open shell, cd to project root and install required pip packages (note that you may have to change path to your pre-compiled wheel wxPython distribution in Pipfile (also running pipfile lock and adding missing hash which will be provided in error message to Pipfile.lock), as building wxPython from source takes much time):</p>
			<ul>
				<li>sudo apt install python-pip</li>
				<li>sudo pip install pipenv</li>
				<li>pipenv install</li>
				<li>pipenv shell</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Now, you should be able to launch hydrus with command like:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>python ./client.py</li>
			</ul>

			<p>For Windows, depending on which compiler you are using, pip can have problems building some modules like lz4 and lxml. <a href="http://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/">This page</a> has a lot of prebuilt binaries--I have found it very helpful many times. You may want to update python's sqlite3.dll as well--you can get it <a href="https://www.sqlite.org/download.html">here</a>, and just drop it in C:\Python27\DLLs or wherever you have python installed. I have a fair bit of experience with Windows python, so send me a mail if you need help.</a>
			<p>You will also need wxPython 4.0. This can be simple or complicated. For Windows and OS X, just get it with pip like the rest:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>pip install wxPython</li>
			</ul>
			<p>YMMV. Feel free to email me if you run into trouble or discover any neat tricks.</p>
			<p>OS X 10.9 is easier these days. If you can't get opencv working from pip, this should do it:</p>
			<p><ul>
				<li>brew tap homebrew/homebrew-science</li>
				<li>brew install opencv <i>(or try opencv3, although I have had trouble with this)</i></li>
				<li>export PYTHONPATH=/usr/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages:$PYTHONPATH</li>
			</ul></p>
			<p>If you don't have ffmpeg in your path and you want to import videos, you will need to put a static <a href="https://ffmpeg.org/">FFMPEG</a> executable in the install_dir/bin directory. Have a look at how I do it in the extractable compiled releases if you can't figure it out. You can either copy the exe from one of those releases, or download the latest build right from the FFMPEG site. I don't include these exes in the source release just because they are so big.</a>
			<p>Once you have everything set up, client.pyw and server.py should look for and run off client.db and server.db just like the executables. They will look in the 'db' directory by default, or anywhere you point them with the "-d" parameter.</p>
			<p>I develop hydrus on and am most experienced with Windows, so the program is much more stable and reasonable on that. I do not have as much experience with Linux or OS X, so I would particularly appreciate your Linux/OS X bug reports and any informed suggestions.</p>
			<h3>my code</h3>
			<p>Unlike most software people, I am more INFJ than INTP/J. My coding style is unusual and unprofessional, and everything is pretty much hacked together. Please look through the source if you are interested in how things work and ask me if you don't understand something. I'm constantly throwing new code together and then cleaning and overhauling it down the line.</p>
			<p>I work alone, so while I am very interested in detailed bug reports or suggestions for good libraries to use, I am not looking for pull requests. Everything is <a href="http://sam.zoy.org/wtfpl/COPYING">WTFPL</a>, so feel free to fork and play around with things on your end as much as you like.</p>
